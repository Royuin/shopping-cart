# Shopping Cart

A mock e-commerce react app that allows users to browse products add them to a cart that stores them. Users are also able to select the quantity of the product and change or remove on the cart page as well.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS
- React Router
- React Testing Library/Jest

## What Was Learned

This project was great at solidifying my knowledge of react while also introducing new features like using react router to make a SPA (single page application). Using react testing library to test react components was something else that had to be tackled, which surprisingly was the most difficult part of this project. There was other small things that were learned such as css transitions for the project cards to create a drop down overlay on a card hovered. Initally it was made for desktop only but after learning about responsive development, the entire website was made to be fully responsive. This includes showing a different navigation menu on small screens.

## To Do

- Make tests for renderProducts pass with components using useOutletContext instead of props
- Create a single renderProducts function that takes parameter to choose what products to filter out
- Test w3 validator if main tag can be used on each page with different routes
- Refactor to use Typescript
